# Modelling the Holstein Hamiltonian for Polarons/Charges

What is Holstein Hamiltonian?

The Holstein molecular crystal Hamiltonian was originally introduced by Holstein in 1959 to describe the coupling of charges to vibrational degrees of freedom in molecular aggregates. Holstein Hamiltonian is an extension to the Frenkel Exciton Hamiltonian. The model has been extended to describe the coupling of Frenkel Excitons/polarons to the normal modes localized on individual chromophores. We have developed the model to understand polaron delocalization lengths and mid-IR spectral signatures for both homopolymers and Donor Acceptor Copolymers. 


What is included in the code?

This was my first project after joining Dr. Spano's group; where I had to model the Holstein Hamiltonian for polarons using a multiparticle basis set. The details of multiparticle basis set and the theory can be found in the references mentioned below. I have given a short explanation about the model. Please look into the powerpoint in the repository. I will keep updating the powerpoint over time. 


Please go through the following references for detailed understanding of the model. Let me know if you any questions regarding the model.
